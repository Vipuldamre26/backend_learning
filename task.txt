So we are designing a RestAPI - JSON

GET /users - List all users


so for mobile app we can use /api to send json it is best practice
GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1
GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2

Dynamic Path Parameters
GET /api/users/:id
:id --> Variable | Dynamic   

POST /api/users - Create new user

PATCH /api/users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE /api/user/1 - Delete the user with ID 1
